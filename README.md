# Categorization_Model_Animals
Trained a prototype model and an exemplar model that categorize 53 animals into birds and fish based on 44 features, with Data adapted from Leuven Concept Database.

## Implementation Highlights
* First visualized the animal data points into 2D graph through multidimentional scaling. 
* Used python pandas library to train the prototype model and exemplar model. 
* Evaluate the models by standard leave-one-animal-out cross validation and increased predictive accuracy to 90%.
